<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Brady and I'm currently studying to become a Software Developer.<br />
  I am currently enrolled in my Bachelor's at DeVry University and taking courses on Udemy.<br />
  The reason I chose this career is because I love to solve problems and create new things.<br />
  I have found myself to be very meticulous. When I see websites or features in games that<br />
  look off (I'm looking at you Call of Duty), I want to do something about it.</p>
